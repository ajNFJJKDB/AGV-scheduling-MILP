main file - updated8.py

## Project Description
This project aims to optimize the scheduling and management of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in a modern industrial setting. By implementing a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, the system ensures efficient task allocation, workload balancing, and charging management for AGVs. The primary focus is to minimize idle times, reduce environmental impact, and maximize charge utilization while ensuring all tasks are completed within specified time windows.

## Key Features
- **Optimized Scheduling**: Uses MILP to ensure tasks are assigned efficiently, minimizing idle time and maximizing operational output.
- **Charge Management**: Ensures AGVs charge during idle periods to avoid running out of power during tasks.
- **Workload Balance**: Distributes tasks across AGVs evenly to prevent overuse or underutilization.
- **Environmental Impact**: The model emphasizes reducing carbon footprint by ensuring efficient energy usage.
- **Real-time Visualizations**: Outputs include interactive graphs to visualize AGV operations, task timelines, and charge levels.

## Objectives
- Develop an optimized AGV scheduling model to enhance operational efficiency.
- Maximize AGV fleet utilization while managing battery levels effectively.
- Achieve load balancing across the fleet by evenly distributing tasks.
- Minimize idle time while maximizing the charging time during breaks in task execution.

## Components
1. **AGV Scheduling Model**: 
    - Solves the AGV scheduling problem using MILP with the Gurobi optimizer.
    - Ensures tasks start and end within their respective time windows.
    - Allocates tasks to AGVs based on capability requirements.
  
2. **Charging Management**: 
    - Ensures AGVs charge during idle time, maximizing operational efficiency.
    - Prevents AGVs from running out of power during task execution.
